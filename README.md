## 🚀 What are you looking for? 
Anyways, I’m Diego, a full-stack developer focus on front end, who pairs React & TypeScript with Node.js or Python to create fast, accessible interfaces—now experimenting with AI to make them smarter.

I thrive on turning complex ideas into calm, high-performance web and mobile apps, backed by solid database design (PostgreSQL / MongoDB) and clean Git workflows. Figma and short Scrum loops keep the process human.

Currently exploring how generative AI can improve UX for fintech and healthcare tools that serve elderly and cognitively-impaired users.
